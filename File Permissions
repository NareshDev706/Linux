File Permissions in LINUX
=========================
A File can have 3 permissions 
1. Read (r)
2. Write (w)
3. Execute (e)

=> File permissions are devided into 3 sections
Section 1 : User Permissions (first 3 characters rep User Permissions)
Section 2 : Group Permissions (From 4th to 6th character rep Group Permissions)
Section 3 : Others Permissions (From 7th to 9th character rep Group Permissions)

Example:
              -rw-rw-r--  1 beerenaresh beerenaresh    0 Sep  2 00:36 file1.txt
              drwxrwxr-x  2 beerenaresh beerenaresh 4096 Sep  2 00:41 shanvika/

-  ===> Indicates the Text File
d  ===> Indicates the Directry File

By default text file persmissions are
     -rw-rw-r--
By default Directry File Permissions are 
     drwxrwxr-x
